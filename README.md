# Play around

- Repository: `play-around`
- Type of Challenge: `Learning`
- Duration: `4 days`
- Team challenge : `solo`

## Learning Objectives
- Apply OOP in PHP
- Adhere to the [best practises](../0.Getting-started-with-PHP/PHP-best-practises.md) we've assembled together

## The Mission
We're a couple of months in, and you're still going strong! ðŸ’ª
Remember the early days, when we were building a casino... why not play around again and use it to practise out shiny new class knowledge?

Disclaimer: while classes definitely help structuring projects as they grow, it can be a bit of a puzzle to have everything fit together.
We've provided some [starter packs](./Starter-packs) for the first games to get you going ðŸš€
They provide both a basic structure and some todo's to guide you.

### Must-have features

We will use the same rules as [before](../../2.The-Hill/2.Casino-royale).

- Guessing game (suggested: 1 day or less)
- Rock, paper, scissors (suggested: 1 day)
- Blackjack (suggested: time left)
